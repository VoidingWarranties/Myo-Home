To Do:
------

- Implement thermostat control and an on-screen thermostat to take the place of a real Nest thermostat
- Add a party mode (raise the roof strobes the lights)
- Implement waveUp and waveDown to turn on and off all lights once Myo-Intelligesture has implemented the gestures
- Switch controlled media application to VLC for demos
