To Do:
------

- Implement thermostat control and an on-screen thermostat to take the place of a real Nest thermostat
- Add a party mode (raise the roof strobes the lights)
- Switch controlled media application to VLC for demos

In Progress:
------------

- Implement waveUp and waveDown to turn on and off all lights once Myo-Intelligesture has implemented the gestures
  - There is a basic version of this implemented in MyoHome. This functionality should be moved to Myo-Intelligesture by created an expanded Pose enum.
